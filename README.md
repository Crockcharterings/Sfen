## This project is now retired.

Dear Android users,

It took me too long to develop first alpha version; XDA developers really helped me a-lot with development, 
however, because of lack of free time, resources and personal interests, I'm now retiring the project. I know I 
should do this earlier but there wasn't any feedback at all, no possible solutions or better written Docs for 
functionality I would like to implement. 


The project is Open-sourced and can be freely forked/cloned and updated to latest Android OS versions.

Thank you all for interests! You, the users were the inspiration I've needed.


Best of luck,

Gregor
